## Checklist before merging
- [ ] Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) and initialize it: `pip install pre-commit`, then `pre-commit install`. Pre-commit installs git hooks that automatically check the codebase. If pre-commit fails when you commit your changes, please fix the problems it points out.
- [ ] If I added new phrases to the user interface, I have ran prettier `cd frontend/static/locales; python collect_phrases.py` to collect them for translation.
