        # Coordinator Registration
        This form is for registering a new default coordinator on the RoboSats client. Before proceeding, please review the [RoboSats Federation Basis](https://github.com/RoboSats/robosats/blob/main/federation.md). The Github thread generated by this issue will serve as a communication channel between the development team and the new coordinator, if necessary. The information provided will be used to create a new entry in `frontend/static/federation.json`. If you're technically proficient and wish to expedite the process, you can directly edit `federation.json` via a pull request. Here's a template coordinator:

        ```json

        All fields can be updated or completed later through pull requests. Don't worry about getting everything perfect initially. A partially completed form is better than none. It's okay if your data policy, privacy policy, node ids, and endpoints aren't fully defined or are subject to change.

  # Development Funding
  - type: markdown
    attributes:

        ## Development Funding
        Donations to the Development Fund (DevFund) are voluntary with no minimum amount. The default donation rate in the Coordinator backend is 20%. The value entered here is for display purposes and can be updated later via a PR. Ideally, it should match the donation rate set in your ``.env`` file. The RoboSats client app randomly sorts coordinators weighted by their DevFund donation value. Thus, the orders of the coordinators that contribute to the development have a higher chance to appear first in the Order book. Coordinators who contribute to the DevFund are more likely to receive support if needed (note that unless the devs are under time constraints support is unlikely to be denied). These patron perks are the way developers say "thank you for your contribution!". The RoboSats development team has an exciting roadmap ahead. However, once RoboSats is decentralized, the only source of funding for further development and maintaining the codebase will be donations (we do not accept venture-capital investments).

  # Coordinator Policies

        ## Coordinator Policies
        The following three sections are designed to inform robots about your service expectations as a coordinator. It's perfectly acceptable to refine your policies over time, as coordinating RoboSats is a learning process. However, remember that robots appreciate clear and concise terms.
  - type: textarea
    id: privacy-policy
    attributes:
      label: Privacy Policy
      description: |
        Describe how you will handle privacy. For example, what kind of evidence will be required in a dispute? How will sensitive information be treated?
      placeholder: |
        e.g., 1) TLSnotary might be required for evidence submission in disputes. 2) Full user identification may be necessary to verify ownership of the payment method.
    validations:
      required: true
  - type: textarea
    id: data-policy
    attributes:
      label: Data Policy
      description: |
        Explain your data handling practices. For instance, what is your data retention policy? Will data be shared with third parties? Although a RoboSats coordinator's data collection is limited by design, a coordinator could still learn about users through heuristic analysis, payout node pubkeys, onchain addresses, dispute statements, evidence submission, etc.
      placeholder: |
        e.g., Data will not be shared or sold to any third party. The database will be cleared every 7 days, except for orders under dispute...

  # Coordinator Addresses
  - type: markdown
    attributes:
      value: |
        ## Coordinator Addresses
        Your coordinator API should be publicly accessible via an Onion hidden service. Optionally, you can also expose your API over I2P for redundancy, ensuring robots can still use your service if TOR is under attack. Clearnet endpoints can also be added to your coordinator. You can create new tor2web aliases on services like clearnetonion.eu.org or others (do your own research).
