    The RoboSats REST API is on v0, which in other words, is beta.
    We recommend that if you don't have time to actively maintain
    your project, do not build it with v0 of the API. A refactored, simpler
    and more stable version - v1 will be released soonâ„¢.

        Get the order details. Details include/exclude attributes according to what is the status of the order

        The following fields are available irrespective of whether you are a participant or not (A participant is either a taker or a maker of an order)
        All the other fields are only available when you are either the taker or the maker of the order:

        - `id`
        - `status`
        - `created_at`
        - `expires_at`
        - `type`
        - `currency`
        - `amount`
        - `has_range`

        - `is_participant`
        - `maker_status`
        - `taker_status`
        - `price_now`

        ### Order Status

        The response of this route changes according to the status of the order. Some fields are documented below (check the 'Responses' section)
        with the status code of when they are available and some or not. With v1 API we aim to simplify this
        route to make it easier to understand which fields are available on which order status codes.

        `status` specifies the status of the order. Below is a list of possible values (status codes) and what they mean:
        - `0` "Waiting for maker bond"
        - `1` "Public"
        - `2` "Paused"
        - `3` "Waiting for taker bond"
        - `4` "Cancelled"
        - `5` "Expired"
        - `6` "Waiting for trade collateral and buyer invoice"
        - `7` "Waiting only for seller trade collateral"
        - `8` "Waiting only for buyer invoice"
        - `9` "Sending fiat - In chatroom"
        - `10` "Fiat sent - In chatroom"
        - `11` "In dispute"
        - `12` "Collaboratively cancelled"
        - `13` "Sending satoshis to buyer"
        - `14` "Sucessful trade"
        - `15` "Failed lightning network routing"
        - `16` "Wait for dispute resolution"
        - `17` "Maker lost dispute"
        - `18` "Taker lost dispute"


        Notes:
        - both `price_now` and `premium_now` are always calculated irrespective of whether `is_explicit` = true or false

        Update an order

        `action` field is required and determines what is to be done. Below
        is an explanation of what each action does:

        - `take`
          - If the order has not expired and is still public, on a
            successful take, you get the same response as if `GET /order`
            was called and the status of the order was `3` (waiting for
            taker bond) which means `bond_satoshis` and `bond_invoice` are
            present in the response as well. Once the `bond_invoice` is
            paid, you successfully become the taker of the order and the
            status of the order changes.
        - `pause`
          - Toggle the status of an order from `1` to `2` and vice versa. Allowed only if status is `1` (Public) or `2` (Paused)
        - `update_invoice`
          - This action only is valid if you are the buyer. The `invoice`
            field needs to be present in the body and the value must be a
            valid LN invoice as cleartext PGP message signed with the robot key. Make sure to perform this action only when
            both the bonds are locked. i.e The status of your order is
            at least `6` (Waiting for trade collateral and buyer invoice)
        - `update_address`
          - This action is only valid if you are the buyer. This action is
            used to set an on-chain payout address if you wish to have your
            payout be received on-chain. Only valid if there is an address in the body as
            cleartext PGP message signed with the robot key. This enables on-chain swap for the
            order, so even if you earlier had submitted a LN invoice, it
            will be ignored. You get to choose the `mining_fee_rate` as
            well. Mining fee rate is specified in sats/vbyte.
        - `cancel`
          - This action is used to cancel an existing order. You cannot cancel an order if it's in one of the following states:
            - `1` - Cancelled
            - `5` - Expired
            - `11` - In dispute
            - `12` - Collaboratively cancelled
            - `13` - Sending satoshis to buyer
            - `14` - Successful trade
            - `15` - Failed lightning network routing
            - `17` - Maker lost dispute
            - `18` - Taker lost dispute

            Note that there are penalties involved for cancelling a order
            mid-trade so use this action carefully:

            - As a maker if you cancel an order after you have locked your
              maker bond, you are returned your bond. This may change in
              the future to prevent DDoSing the LN node and you won't be
              returned the maker bond.
            - As a taker there is a time penalty involved if you `take` an
              order and cancel it without locking the taker bond.
            - For both taker or maker, if you cancel the order when both
              have locked their bonds (status = `6` or `7`), you loose your
              bond and a percent of it goes as "rewards" to your
              counterparty and some of it the platform keeps. This is to
              discourage wasting time and DDoSing the platform.
            - For both taker or maker, if you cancel the order when the
              escrow is locked (status = `8` or `9`), you trigger a
              collaborative cancel request. This sets
              `(m|t)aker_asked_cancel` field to `true` depending on whether
              you are the maker or the taker respectively, so that your
              counterparty is informed that you asked for a cancel.
            - For both taker or maker, and your counterparty asked for a
              cancel (i.e `(m|t)aker_asked_cancel` is true), and you cancel
              as well, a collaborative cancel takes place which returns
              both the bonds and escrow to the respective parties. Note
              that in the future there will be a cost for even
              collaborativelly cancelling orders for both parties.
        - `confirm`
          - This is a **crucial** action. This confirms the sending and
            receiving of fiat depending on whether you are a buyer or
            seller. There is not much RoboSats can do to actually confirm
            and verify the fiat payment channel. It is up to you to make
            sure of the correct amount was received before you confirm.
            This action is only allowed when status is either `9` (Sending
            fiat - In chatroom) or `10` (Fiat sent - In chatroom)
            - If you are the buyer, it simply sets `fiat_sent` to `true`
              which means that you have sent the fiat using the payment
              method selected by the seller and signals the seller that the
              fiat payment was done.
            - If you are the seller, be very careful and double check
              before performing this action. Check that your fiat payment
              method was successful in receiving the funds and whether it
              was the correct amount. This action settles the escrow and
              pays the buyer and sets the the order status to `13` (Sending
              satohis to buyer) and eventually to `14` (successful trade).
        - `undo_confirm`
          - This action will undo the fiat_sent confirmation by the buyer
            it is allowed only once the fiat is confirmed as sent and can
            enable the collaborative cancellation option if an off-robosats
            payment cannot be completed or is blocked.
        - `dispute`
          - This action is allowed only if status is `9` or `10`. It sets
            the order status to `11` (In dispute) and sets `is_disputed` to
            `true`. Both the bonds and the escrow are settled (i.e RoboSats
            takes custody of the funds). Disputes can take long to resolve,
            it might trigger force closure for unresolved HTLCs). Dispute
            winner will have to submit a new invoice for value of escrow +
            bond.
        - `submit_statement`
          - This action updates the dispute statement. Allowed only when
            status is `11` (In dispute). `statement` must be sent in the
            request body and should be a string. 100 chars < length of
            `statement` < 5000 chars. You need to describe the reason for
            raising a dispute. The `(m|t)aker_statement` field is set
            respectively. Only when both parties have submitted their
            dispute statement, the order status changes to `16` (Waiting
            for dispute resolution)
        - `rate_platform`
          - Let us know how much you love (or hate ðŸ˜¢) RoboSats.
            You can rate the platform from `1-5` using the `rate` field in the request body

        Get robot info ðŸ¤–

        An authenticated request (has the token's sha256 hash encoded as base 91 in the Authorization header) will be
        returned the information about the state of a robot.

        Make sure you generate your token using cryptographically secure methods. [Here's]() the function the Javascript
        client uses to generate the tokens. Since the server only receives the hash of the
        token, it is responsibility of the client to create a strong token. Check
        [here](https://github.com/RoboSats/robosats/blob/main/frontend/src/utils/token.js)
        to see how the Javascript client creates a random strong token and how it validates entropy is optimal for tokens
        created by the user at will.

        `public_key` - PGP key associated with the user (Armored ASCII format)
        `encrypted_private_key` - Private PGP key. This is only stored on the backend for later fetching by
        the frontend and the key can't really be used by the server since it's protected by the token
        that only the client knows. Will be made an optional parameter in a future release.
        On the Javascript client, It's passphrase is set to be the secret token generated.

        A gpg key can be created by:

        ```shell
        gpg --full-gen-key
        ```

        it's public key can be exported in ascii armored format with:

        ```shell
        gpg --export --armor <key-id | email | name>
        ```

        and it's private key can be exported in ascii armored format with:

        ```shell
        gpg --export-secret-keys --armor <key-id | email | name>
        ```
