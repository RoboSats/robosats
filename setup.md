# Set up
*Attention: to use RoboSats you do not need to run the stack, simply visit the website and that's it! This setup guide is intended for developer contributors and coordinator operators.*

# Frontend Development Only
Running the full stack is not easy, since RoboSats needs of many services. However, contributing to the frontend development can be done with a minimal setup!

## With Docker
You can develop frontend-only features using the mainnet backend of the platform by simply running the sovereign node app locally and the `npm-dev` container. The orchestration in `/nodeapp/docker-compose.yml` will run a Tor proxy and torify all requests, as well as, watch for changes to the frontend source files, build it, and place it in the right `/static/`

```bash
cd nodeapp
docker-compose up
# Press Ctrl+C to exit the process
# Check out http://localhost:12596 on your browser
```

You can edit the frontend code in `/frontend/src/` to make the changes you want. Within a few seconds, the `npm-dev` container process will pack the code into the local `main.js`. Visit `http://localhost:12596` and you will see your changes on the frontend.

**You are ready to go!** Edit the frontend code in `/frontend/src/` to make the changes you want. Within a few seconds, the `npm run dev` process will pack the code into the local `main.js`. Visit your selected {robosats-site} and you will see your new awesome frontend! :)

Every time you save changes to files in `/frontend/src` you will be able to see them in your browser after a few seconds using force refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R).

If you need to edit CSS or other static files in `/frontend/static`, simply add them to Requestly in the same way.

i.e: index.css
Make "{robosats-site}/static/css/index.css" redirect to "127.0.0.1:8080/css/index.css"

# Documentation Jekyll Site Only
Simply run the de docker-compose within /docs/ in order to watch files, build and serve the Learn RoboSats site locally.
```bash
cd docs
docker-compose up
# press Ctrl+C to exit the process
```
Then visit `127.0.0.1:4000` on your browser. Once you save changes on a file it will take around 10s for the site to update (press <Ctrl+Shift+R> to force-refresh your browser).

# Full Stack Development

## The Easy Way: Docker-compose (-dev containers running on testnet)

*Set up time, anywhere between ~45 min and 1 full day (depending on experience, whether you have a copy of the testnet blockchain, etc). Tested in Ubuntu.

Spinning up docker for the first time
```bash
docker-compose up -d
docker exec -it django-dev python3 manage.py createsuperuser
# Once requested for the new superuser name, make sure to use the same name you have in the .env-sample variable ESCROW_USERNAME. By default 'admin'.
docker-compose restart
```
Copy the `.env-sample` file into `.env` and check the environmental variables are right for your development.

## Running tests

Build and run containers with the test specific configuration:
```
docker compose -f docker-tests.yml --env-file ./tests/compose.env up -d
```

Run tests:
```
docker exec -it test-coordinator coverage run manage.py test
```

If you want to run tests with CLN:
```
LNVENDOR='CLN'
```

## All set!

Commands you will need to startup:

* Spinning up the docker orchestration:
`docker-compose up -d`

* Then monitor in a terminal the Django dev docker service
`docker attach django-dev`

* And the NPM dev docker service
`docker attach npm-dev`

* You could also just check all services logs
`docker-compose logs -f`

You will need these commands also often or eventually:

* Use `unlock` or `create` your lnd node
`docker exec -it lnd-dev lncli unlock`

* Create p2wkh addresses
`docker exec -it lnd-dev lncli --network=testnet newaddress p2wkh`

* Wallet balance
`docker exec -it lnd-dev lncli --network=testnet walletbalance`

* Connect to peer
`docker exec -it lnd-dev lncli --network=testnet connect node_id@ip:9735`

* Open channel
`docker exec -it lnd-dev lncli --network=testnet openchannel node_id --local_amt LOCAL_AMT --push_amt PUSH_AMT`

* Lock a bond from your own `lnd-dev` node
`docker exec -it lnd-dev lncli -network=testnet payinvoice <BOLT_11_INVOICE> --allow_self_payment`

**RoboSats development site should be accessible on 127.0.0.1:8000**
