# Android Pre-release

Android pre-release for testing. This pre-releases has @KoalaSats #247 torified requests through webview. While the app is not fully functioional (no cookies, therefore no permanent robot and no authenticated requests are possible), it would be great to start testing Tor requests in different systems.

This releases has two assets. A release-like APK and a debug APK (it will show logs for errors).
