Sovereignty is scary at first, then liberating. Buying your first Sats from a peer might seem intimidating, but it is very empowering. In Learn.RoboSats you can find all of the documentation and resources so you feel comfortable using the RoboSats P2P exchange. From easy to follow video tutorials, to technical deep-dives into how the exchange works. 

This site is under construction, just like the exchange itself. Check around, you probably can write up and complete some of the missing pages. Have fun!
