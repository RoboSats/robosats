Got artistic talent? Consider drawing fan art and promoting RoboSats through sweet visuals! A picture is worth a thousand words, and also generates more engagement than longform articles. We aren't looking for Vincent van Gogh or Pablo Picasso, just excited individuals who like to draw and share the good word of buying/selling peer-to-peer!

## Ideas

There really is no limit here! If you want to brainstorm, feel free to message the [public SimpleX support groups](https://learn.robosats.org/contribute/code/#communication-channels). The coordinator for RoboSats art is [@Red_Purdy](https://twitter.com/Red_Purdy) and can help provide ideas!

One example of using art to create community engagement includes [Telegram stickers](https://t.me/addstickers/Robosats1). The linked stickers features the quasi mascot Robotoshi.
