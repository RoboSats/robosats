RoboSats is an easy way to privately exchange bitcoin for national currencies. It simplifies the peer-to-peer experience and makes use of [lightning hold invoices](/docs/escrow/#what-is-a-hold-invoice) to minimize custody and trust requirements between peers. You can also use RoboSats to perform peer-to-peer [swaps](/docs/swaps/).

**Let's go!** To start using RoboSats, you only need a [<i class='fa-solid fa-wallet'></i>  Lightning Wallet](/docs/wallets/) and a [TOR-enabled browser](/docs/tor/).
