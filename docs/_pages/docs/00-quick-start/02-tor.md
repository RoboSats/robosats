[The Onion Router](https://www.torproject.org/download/), or TOR for short, is a FOSS and privacy-oriented internet browser that enables anonymous communication. Thousands of volunteer relays make up the network to direct internet traffic worldwide for free. RoboSats utilizes TOR as a layer of privacy and therefore [accessing RoboSats](/docs/access/#-privately-with-tor) via TOR is strongly recommended.

A supported alternative to TOR is the [I2P project](/docs/access/#-privately-with-i2p). You can also use a TOR-compatible browser, like Brave, but users should always assume they are being spied on and take care to access RoboSats safely.

## **Issues With TOR**

Utilizing TOR has drawbacks such as lower network connection speeds, sporadic [downtime](https://status.torproject.org/) due to DDoS, and imperfect privacy with regards to website fingerprinting techniques.
