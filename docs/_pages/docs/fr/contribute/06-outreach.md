The single best way to support RoboSats is by simply using it and telling others to try it out! Without peers providing liquidity to the order books, peer-to-peer exchanges like us would cease to exist! When peers use RoboSats and invite others to give it a try, liquidity grows and then the platform can support even more users!

The best we can do is reason with users of why they should value their privacy and avoid anti-privacy exchanges. Refer to this [article](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/culture/the-value-of-p2p-bitcoin-exchanges), written by a RoboSats contributor, explaining some of the reasons why users should consider protecting their privacy and using P2P exchanges like RoboSats.

## Social Media

Social media is a great opportunity for word-of-mouth advertising of RoboSats. If you had a great experience using RoboSats or have interesting insight to share about the project, please do say something! Shout it from the robo-heavens!

For example, you could post on Nostr and tag the RoboSats Nostr account (npub1p2psats79rypr8lpnl9t5qdekfp700x660qsgw284xvq4s09lqrqqk3m82) so that it can be shared with others! Or, if you are on Twitter, create a tweet and tag the [RoboSats Twitter](https://twitter.com/RoboSats) account.

Any help would be greatly appreciated in this sector! More order book liquidity attracts more users and thus more users get to take advantage of buying and selling bitcoin privately!
