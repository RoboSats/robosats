<!-- TODO: Should you open a channel to RoboSats node? Depends. Establish the 3 cases: 1) as a seller (good idea, cheap and reliable, but they might get closed eventually if unsused), 2) as a buyer (it does not matter, buyers do not pay routing fees. Privacy is the same) 3) as a routing node (Woah, super useful! Yet we cannot guarantee robosats will be a good routing partner: 1) locked many small HTLCs for long periods 2) has high fees 3) yet, it does generate lot of legit movement of Sats, and double routing the same order is possible. 4) sats will always be on your side, and that's ok! By desing it is how liquidity is the most useful!) -->
